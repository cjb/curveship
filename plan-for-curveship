* Populate inventory list
* Move into the first room
* When moving into any room:
** Find out what type of exits and objects the room has
** Draw a room with those exits and objects
** Show and speak the flavortext for the new room
** Put an invisible "exit" object on the exit
** If the exit object is stepped on, leave the room in the current movement direction

* When the player is on top of an object, highlight previously-greyed-out commands that are possible (pick up, use with)
* use with can be standalone or in combination with an inventory object

useful:

world_model.WorldOrConcept.doors() -> [rooms]
    for (direction, room) in world.room_of(focalizer).exits.items():




world_info(), wc_info() -> report()

preparer.prepare()
handle_input() -> 
	       simulator()
			actions_to_do.extend()
			commanded.do_command()
			action.do() ->
				    self.change(world)
       <- world, discourse
presenter.present

How are we going to model/draw the map?
* ultimately we want an ascii art diagram
* but we should also keep track of which rooms we've drawn where
* to avoid overwriting rooms (e.g. W->N->E->S != orig), we could just draw
  the last two rooms or something
* so the class that prepares the ascii art needs to know:
  * which room is the player in
  * exits/objects

graphical room model:
  for each room:
     block out some space for it, @label => ([10,10], [16,20])
     set(seen) = last two labels entered
     when drawing, draw the last two labels
